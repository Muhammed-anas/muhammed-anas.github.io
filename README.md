# 👋 Hi, I'm Muhammed Anas

Welcome to my developer portfolio. I'm passionate about software development, Artificial Intelligence, and building physical robots that interact with the real world. This portfolio is a space where I share my projects, skills, and long-term vision.

## 🚀 About Me

I specialize in Python-based development, with a growing focus on AI and robotics. Over time, I’ve built a range of projects — from automation bots to intelligent web applications — and I'm now exploring ways to bring AI into the physical world through robotics.

## 🧠 My Mission in AI

My goal is to create **AI-powered robots** that go beyond conversation — robots that can see, listen, understand, and respond in meaningful ways. Inspired by technologies like ChatGPT, I'm working toward systems that bridge the gap between software and physical interaction.

To me, AI is not just about automation — it's about creating technology that enhances how humans interact with machines in everyday life.
