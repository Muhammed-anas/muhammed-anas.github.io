# 👋 Hi, I'm Muhammed Anas

Welcome to my developer portfolio! I'm a **Python Developer** with a deep passion for **Artificial Intelligence**, **Full Stack Web Development**, and building **intelligent physical robots**. This portfolio reflects my journey and vision—creating meaningful software that bridges the gap between humans and machines.

## 🚀 About Me

With a strong foundation in Python and web technologies, I build dynamic web apps, automate processes, and experiment with AI-powered solutions. My ambition lies in blending AI with robotics—developing systems that don’t just respond intelligently but also **see**, **hear**, and **move**.

> _"Code is where logic meets creativity, and AI is where machines meet intelligence."_

## 🤖 My Mission: AI Meets the Real World

I'm working toward a future where AI isn’t just in the cloud—but in **everyday robots** that assist us, learn from us, and understand context through vision, speech, and interaction.

Inspired by technologies like **ChatGPT**, I aim to develop systems that think, speak, and act—**AI with a physical presence**.
